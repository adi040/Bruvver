## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep brown (#4A3022) to evoke the rich aroma and taste of coffee. The hue reminds the user of the raw materials in coffee cultivation, as well as classic and comforting brand identities in the coffee industry.
- Background color: Light tan (#F2E8D5), a very desaturated tint of the primary, to provide a warm, inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#D35400), analogous to the primary, to draw attention to key elements such as call-to-action buttons and notifications.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text, conveying a balance of aesthetic sensibility and readability.
- Use clean, minimalist icons related to coffee and the menu items. Icons should complement the overall warm aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout with ample white space to enhance readability and focus.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations when navigating between the menu and item details, enhancing the user experience.
